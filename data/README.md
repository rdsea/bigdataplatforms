# Free Datasets for Practices

## Open Datasets

There are many open datasets that you can download for practicing activities in big data platforms. It is suggested that **you focus on a single domain and use the data to perform the work in the course**. The following datasets can be used for both batch and streaming analytics and used in different tasks (ingestion, processing, etc.)
