# Course FAQ
### Will the course be carried in online?

No. the course will be in contact teaching in the campus again. There will be no video record. 

### Number of accepted students
The number of open slots for registration will be from **40-80**, dependent on how many teaching assistants (TA) we can have:

* Unfortunately, hiring TAs is very difficult and out of the control of the responsible teacher. Therefore, the best way to ensure the quality is to limit the number of slots.

So pls. watch out the registration and do the registration as early as possible. 

### I have registered the course but my registration was rejected, why?
The course has a limited number of slots (see above). Furthermore, each year, during the selection, the course may reduce/increase the number of slots due to the availability of hired TAs (the hiring is difficult due to the lack of qualified TAs and the situation is known only before starting the course). The main reasons for rejection are to maintain the prerequisites and to maintain the quality of the course, **which is strongly dependent on the resources we have for the course**.  Therefore, we put some key requirements for registration acceptance. Rejection reasons could be:
- Your study programme is not suitable and/or in the target  study programme of the course. Examples are: (i) not in CCIS master study, (ii) still in the BSc study phase, (iii) from adult/continuous learning programme (FITech), (iv) exchange study programme with unclear prerequisites
- Your prerequisites are not fulfilled: lack of background in cloud computing, data management, data mining, etc.
- Your study programme is not in the priority of the course, e.g., not in the big data track and/or the course is not in the recommended target  study programme of the course.
- You have a chance to study in previous years (e.g., registered but dropped or not registered for a couple of years, although your study right allows you to study the course years)

Examples of conditions for selected over others:
- In the CCIS big data track with  the prerequisites fulfilled.
- Not in the big data track but the course is in the list of optional ones (in appropriate study programmes) and with fulfilled prerequisites.
- In an appropriate exchange study with fulfilled prerequisites or in the big data track
- In a doctoral programme with appropriate prerequisites.

It is unfortunate that we have to reject your registration when our resource is not enough. In this case, you might be interested in the course audit (follow the course without assignment submission/access).

### I have registered the course long before the registration deadline and before many others, is it unfair to reject my registration

The registration time has no effect on the acceptance/rejection. See also [the official document here](https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/SISEN/Registration+for+courses#Registrationforcourses-Differenttypesofregistration).

### I forgot to register and the deadline has passed just an hour ago, can I register?

Unfortunately: **No**. The deadline has set and there is a reason for that: we need it to determine the acceptances and planning due to our limited resource. The registration period is very long, giving enough time for people to decide. Furthermore, it is a manual selection so all the registrations can be confirmed only after the deadline has passed. If you are interested in the course, you can always register in advance.

### I am a bachelor student, I have fulfilled course prerequisites, why my registration is still rejected?

The course is for advanced master students: from the 2nd semester of the first year master study. In principle, it does not accept bachelor students(unlike some other master courses which accept bachelor students).

### What kind of jobs requires me to learn this course?

We can talk a lot during the course but here some facts:

* [Examples of job description](https://jobs.booking.com/careers/?pid=562949958653616): you will see that what you learn from this course  would help you to get such a job.
* [People invest money to learn the subjects we have in our course](https://www.dataengineer.io/#pricing)

### Is lecture/tutorial participation mandatory?

No. We do not impose any lecture/tutorial participation rules. In principle, you can complete the course without lecture/tutorial participation. It is however important that you should join lectures and tutorials where we can have face-to-face discussions. At the moment, we do not plan to record lectures and tutorials. Note that you may be required to be in person to explain your assignments.

### Is the assignment/project independent work so that I dont have to team up with other students?

Assignment/project work is independent at the moment. Thus you can complete the course without teamwork as long as you obtain enough marks from your assignments. Note that you may be required to be in person to explain your assignments.

Also pay attention of [the severity of academic violations](violations.md)

### Can I complete the course successful without lecture/tutorial participation?

No one knows except you. The course requires both theoretical and engineering understandings of big data platforms but also requires a lot of effort on design, implementation and testing of some key concepts in big data platforms. Lectures/tutorials guide your way but at the end you need to touch a lot of hands-on of real world systems. Having good exchanges and discussions with others can help you to speed up your study.


### I am a student from the business school, do I need to spend a lot of time to design and implement stuffs in big data platforms?

Unfortunately, to understand big data platforms, we need to work on design, development, testing and operation aspects. While, business school students can focus more on utilizing big data platforms for running analytics, we require all students to understand big data platforms from a holistic view in this course.

### Can I learn the course without knowing cloud computing?
Cloud computing is an important background as our big data platforms rely on cloud technologies (not necessarily requires specific cloud providers). If you dont know cloud computing, it will be difficult to finish the course.

### Which are the key backgrounds for being successful in this course?

This course is an advanced one in the core computer science study thus key backgrounds from computer science are
* Distributed systems, especially consistency, replication, and distributed computing infrastructures (with cloud computing models)
* Basic databases and data modeling
* Programming in distributed systems (e.g., develop web services, concurrent programs)

### Can I use my own dataset (e.g. from my company) for exercises/assignments?

Yes you can but you need to discuss with the teacher in charge  first.
