# Tutorials for Data Platforms Course

## Overview

There are several tutorials. We organize them into different sections that one can practice in sync with lectures.

>Some have been discontinued but still they can be useful for learning.

## Other related examples

You might see many code examples about IoT, Edge and Clouds from our [IoTCloudSamples](https://github.com/rdsea/IoTCloudSamples/) that you can reuse for big data studies.

We also play with LLMs for assisting the study:
