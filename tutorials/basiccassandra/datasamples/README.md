Note on the data sources:

- [Bird data](birdsampledata.csv) is a sample from the data set [Avian Vocalizations from CA & NV, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/samhiatt/xenocanto-avian-vocalizations-canv-usa). Note that, we only use the metadata from the CSV file. Furthermore, we extract only a few fields.
- [Water data](water_dataset_v_05.14.24_1000.csv) is a sample from [the OSF water open dataset](https://osf.io/g3zvd/?view_only=63e9c2f0cdf547d792bdd8e93045f89e). We just take 1000 records for the test in this tutorial.
