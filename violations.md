# Academic Violations

**All assignments are individual work. You can discuss with your peer about possible technologies and solutions but the assignment result (the submission) is your sole work**. The following things would be considered violations:
* Reuse existing work without clear clarification of the reuse and what is the new work
  - it is always safe to write clearly how you reuse the code/material and provide a reference
* Copy any part of existing solutions (code, design, document, etc.) from others

We do not have automatic assignment evaluation and we read, check and run the assignment so the chance we detect a violation is **high**. 
>Besides tools are also used for code and text similarity analysis

For code, students should make clearly:

* Reuse code from where by given the source and license.
* Automatic generated code by tools, e.g. [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

## The use of Genenative AI

Generative AI is allowed for **ONLY CODE and SOFTWARE/SYSTEM CONFIGURATION** and a clear clarification must be provided.

Generative AI is **NOT ALLOWED for the assignment report**.

Violations will be treated according to the violation handling procedure.

## The violation handling procedure (based on Aalto)

* [The Aalto detailed procedure](https://into.aalto.fi/display/ensaannot/Aalto+University+Code+of+Academic+Integrity+and+Handling+Violations+Thereof#AaltoUniversityCodeofAcademicIntegrityandHandlingViolationsThereof-4.4Procedure)
* Evidence (violated code, design, document, ...) will be sent to **the School LES Manager**
  - The LES Manager will contact the students and have a hearing
  - The (vice)dean will decide based on these, what will happen:
     >In case of violation: assignment cannot be evaluated (pending).
      **The school will record the student in the case** (more severe consequences if the student has already marking of violations)
    > If the case is not violated, we will continue the  evaluation
